## About

Hi, I'm Patrick Aikens.

## Who I Am

I'm a software engineer, and have been for a very long time. I started in the
video games industry. Since then I have passed through the insurance industry
and the banking industry before ending up at Manheim, Inc. where I am now.

## My Blog

This blog is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a great static website
generator written in Go. I'm using the
[hugo-dusk](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-dusk/) theme. The blog is hosted on
[Github.com](https://github.com/duckpuppy/duckpuppy.com) and is built by
[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/).
